**Ingredients** 

    ▢ 2 pounds potatoes cooked with the skin on, cooled down
    ▢ 2 cups all-purpose flour
    ▢ 1 ¼ cup cream of wheat
    ▢ 1 medium egg
    ▢ ½ tablespoon potato starch
    ▢ 1 teaspoon salt for dumplings, plus more to salt the water

  **Instructions**

    MAKE AHEAD: Boil 2 pounds potatoes with their skins on the day before and let them cool completely, preferably overnight. Before making the potato dough, bring a pot of lightly salted water to a boil on the stove.
    Peel the cooled potatoes and finely shred them using a hand grater.
    Place the shredded potatoes in a large mixing bowl. In a separate bowl, whisk together 2 cups all-purpose flour, 1 ¼ cup cream of wheat, ½ tablespoon potato starch, and 1 teaspoon salt. Add this mixture to the potatoes along with 1 medium egg.
    Knead the potato mixture into a homogeneous, smooth dough. Keep a small amount of flour on the side to dip your hands in case the potato dough becomes too sticky.
    Divide the dough into two equal parts. On a work surface, roll each part into a 2-3 inch (5-7 cm) thick cylinder. The length of the cylinder should be determined by the diameter of the pot you will be cooking the dumplings in, typically around 8-10 inches (20-25 cm).
    Immediately after forming the dumplings, place them in slightly boiling water. After a few minutes, check if they are stuck to the bottom. If so, use a fork to gently release them, allowing them to float.
    Cook the dumplings for 20-23 minutes.
    When cooked, carefully remove the dumplings from the pot. If you have one, use a long slotted spoon.
    If you are not serving the dumplings immediately, brush them with a little melted butter or lard to prevent the surface from drying out. Prick the dumplings with a fork to release the steam from the inside.
